***Array declaration***

let a = [1,2,3,4,5];

(For-in) loop in array:

//For loop can be defined in below method as well in JS.
//To print an array or to do some iterations in an aaray we can use below format.
//This format can be used for manupilating an object as well
//Iteration happens in index level

for(x in a){
    document.write(c[x])
}

//For-of loop dictates that the iteration should happen on each elements in the array.
for(x of c){
    document.write("<br>"+ x)
}
